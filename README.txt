Hello Professor Domanski!!


This is my project: Expense Tracker. 
I made this text document in order to easily navigate you through the folder.

 

I created two seperate .py files in order to simplify the code

- "expensetracker.py": This file is for all of the functions that are necessary to run the program.
- "expensetracker_exe.py": This file is the actual program itself. This is what is executed in the command prompt.


The two Python Libraries

-"docopt.py": Docopt Library
-"tabulate.py": Tabulate Library




Thank you for reading!
